# The fourth time homework-question 1.5 from chapter 1

## Background
Nowadays, computer technologies are applied to all manner of people's life and study. So it is considerably necessary for us to have good command of a kind of computer language especially for us who major in physics. From Chapter 1-A First Numerical Problem, we have learned the way to solve a radioactive decay problem. 
For uranium nuclei decay, it must satisfy the following equation:

Though we have known this equation, it is not enough to work out the figure. Using the Taylor expansion, the question will be simplified easily. One can obtain these formula:


Eventually, we can get a very helpful quation:

It is the key to deal with this problem.
