# The sixth time homework-question 2.10
## Abstract
In the last homework, we have already drawn some trajectories of cannon shells. That situation requires known initial(firing) velocity and firing angle, and we just hit a random target. Of corse, it is not impractical in the war. In fact, what we can know is the distance between enemies(targets) and us.
