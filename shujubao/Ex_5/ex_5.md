# The Fifth Time Homework-Realistic Projectile Motion

## 1.Background
In warfare you generally want to hit a particular target (as opposed to having the cannon shells land indicriminately). Of course, good prediction is quite helpful to realize it. Daily life tell us the trajectory of a cannon shell is related to a lot of factors, including the uniform air drag, the isothermal air drag, the adiabatic air drag and so on. Here, we will take some of them into consideration in the following parts.
